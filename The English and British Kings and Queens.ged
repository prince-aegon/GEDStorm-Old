1 NOTE Prince Charles, born in 1948, Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He is the son of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Philip Mountbatten, duke of Edinburgh. Charles's ful
2 CONC l name is Charles Philip Arthur George. His titles, in addition to Prince of Wales, are duke of Cornwall; duke of Rothesay; earl of Carrick; and Baron Renfrew, lord of the Isles and great steward of Scotland.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Breaking with the tradition of educating royal children at home, his parents enrolled Prince Charles in private schools in England and Scotland. He attended the Cheam School in Berkshire as a boarder from the age of 9 to 14 and the school his fa
2 CONC ther attended, Gordonstoun, in Scotland from age 14 to 18. He has described his school years as unhappy and seems to have been especially ill-suited for the rugged and spartan conditions at Gordonstoun, the school chosen by the Duke of Edinburg
2 CONC h to toughen up his son. After Gordonstoun, Charles entered Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he studied archaeology, anthropology, and history. Charles became the first heir to the British crown to earn a university degree w
2 CONC hen he graduated with honours from Cambridge University in June 1970. That year he also assumed his seat in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of the British Parliament. At the age of 20, in 1969, he was formally invested as the Prince of Wal
2 CONC es, a title he had been given in 1958. Charles served in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1977.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Although he has travelled widely as a representative of the crown, Charles has been viewed as a man with little to do while waiting to succeed to the throne. As one solution he founded the Princes Trust, an organization established to provide op
2 CONC portunities for young people through training, education, and financial support. As its president he has remained closely involved with the trust. Charles is also involved with some 200 other charitable organizations that reflect his wide rang
2 CONC e of interests, from architecture to alternative medicine and conservation.

1 NOTE Elizabeth II, born in 1926, queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary was born in London, the first child of the duke and duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Her sister, Pr
2 CONC incess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home by a Scottish governess.
2 CONT 
2 CONT After her father succeeded to the throne in 1936, Princess Elizabeth, as heiress presumptive, began studies in constitutional history and law to prepare for her future position as queen. As she became older, Elizabeth began to take part in publi
2 CONC c life. She was 14 years old when she made her first radio broadcast, a speech to the children of the Commonwealth of Nations in October 1940. When she was 16 she carried out her first public engagement, an inspection of the Grenadier Guards i
2 CONC n April 1942.
2 CONT 
2 CONT During World War II (1939-1945) Elizabeth and her younger sister were sent for safety from Buckingham Palace in London to live first at Balmoral, Scotland, and later at the royal lodge at Windsor, England. Although her father did not want Elizab
2 CONC eth to be called up for national service during the war, she herself was most eager to join the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the women's branch of the British Army. She was finally allowed to join in March 1945.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On November 20, 1947, Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten, the former Prince Philip of Greece, at Westminster Abbey in London. He had become a British subject nine months earlier and was married under the title of Prince Philip, duke of Edinbur
2 CONC gh. A year later Elizabeth gave birth to a son, Charles. In 1950 she gave birth to a daughter, Anne. A second son, Andrew, was born to Elizabeth in 1960, and a third, Edward, in 1964.

1 NOTE Edward VII (1841-1910), king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and emperor of India (1901-1910). The Edwardian period is named after him. Edward was born on November 9, 1841, in Buckingham Palace, London, the eldest son of Quee
2 CONC n Victoria and Prince Albert, and was christened Albert Edward. He studied at the universities of Edinburgh, Oxford, and Cambridge.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1860 he visited Canada, inaugurating the custom of goodwill visits by members of the British royal family, particularly the Prince of Wales, to British dominions and foreign countries. In 1863 Edward married Alexandra, eldest daughter of Kin
2 CONC g Christian IX of Denmark. The prince and princess then assumed much of the burden of court ceremonials and public functions, which Queen Victoria had laid aside on going into virtual retirement after the death of the prince consort in 1861. Edw
2 CONC ard travelled extensively. In Russia and France, particularly, he made valuable personal contacts in political and social circles.
2 CONT 
2 CONT At home, his popularity was increased both as Prince of Wales and as king by his interest in sports, notably yachting and horse racing; his horses won the Derby in 1896, 1900, and 1909 and the Grand National at Liverpool in 1900. Edward succeede
2 CONC d to the throne in 1901. From the beginning of his reign he adopted a policy of promoting international amity in Europe, where political tension had been mounting. His visits to various European capitals from 1901 to 1904 and return visits to hi
2 CONC m by European rulers helped promote the signing of arbitration treaties in 1903-1904 between Britain and France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Portugal. He was also an important force behind two agreements that strengthened the position of Britai
2 CONC n on the Continent, the Entente Cordiale of 1904 between France and Britain, and a pact between Russia and Britain in 1907.  In 1909 the king and queen paid a diplomatic visit to Emperor William II of Germany (Edwards's nephew) that temporaril
2 CONC y dispelled German suspicion that the increasingly friendly relations between Britain and France and Russia were aimed at weakening Germany. Because of his efforts to increase international amity the king became known as Edward the Peacemaker.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Edward died at Buckingham Palace on May 6, 1910, having reigned for only nine years. Three daughters and two sons were born of the marriage between Edward and Alexandra. The sons were Prince Albert Victor, duke of Clarence, and George, duke of Y
2 CONC ork, who succeeded Edward as George V. In 1896 Edwards youngest daughter, Princess Maude Charlotte Mary Victoria, married her cousin, Prince Charles of Denmark, who later became King Hkon VII of Norway.

2 CONT 
2 CONT The death in 1892 of his elder brother, Albert Victor, duke of Clarence, made George second in line to the succession. He married his brother's fiancé, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, later Mary, queen consort of England, and was created duke o

1 NOTE Edward VIII (1894-1972), king of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and emperor of India (January 20-December 11, 1936), later known as the duke of Windsor. Edward was born Jun e 23, 1894, in White Lodge, Richmond Park, an
2 CONC d was educated at the naval preparatory college at Osborne; the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth; and Magdalen College, University of Oxford.
2 CONT 
2 CONT During World War I he served with the Grenadier Guards in France, Italy, Flanders, and Egypt. In 1919 he undertook the first of many official goodwill tours to Canada and other countries. In the 1920s and 1930s he supported slum-clearance projec
2 CONC ts, aid to the unemployed, and improvement of the working conditions of British miners.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the death of his father, King George V, in January 1936, Edward was proclaimed King Edward VIII. Before long, rumours circulated about his alleged romance with an American, Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson, then married to her second husband, a L
2 CONC ondon shipping broker. On October 20, 1936, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin counselled Edward, as king and head of the Church of England, to remove all cause for the rumours. A week later Mrs. Simpson was granted a divorce, to become final in si
2 CONC x months. In November the king confided to Baldwin that he intended to marry Mrs. Simpson even if it meant his abdication. A morganatic marriage was proposed, but the cabinet was unwilling to accept this compromise. On December 11, 1936, therefo
2 CONC re, the king abdicated in favour of his brother, the duke of York, who became King George VI. Edward received the title duke of Windsor and married Mrs. Simpson in June 1937. Because his wife was not accorded the privileges of a royal duchess i
2 CONC n England, the duke of Windsor resided abroad.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1937 he observed social and housing conditions in Germany and visited Adolf Hitler. During World War II he served as a major general in the British Expeditionary Force, and he was governor of the Bahamas from 1940 to 1945. After the war he li
2 CONC ved as a private British citizen, chiefly in the United States and France. At the funeral of George VI in February 1952, he took part in a British royal ceremony for the first time since his abdication. The duke wrote A King's Story (1951) whic
2 CONC h was made into a film in 1967, and Windsor Revisited (1960). He died May 28, 1972, in Paris.
